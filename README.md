# RTutorial

This resp. is for people who want to learn R as a beginner or to unrust your R skill.

This specific material will not have a full guide of all the functions, but it will cover most of the common functions and command that you will be using for your oeprations or at least your assignment. 

Since some of the codes are quite long, thats the reason why I knit it to .html. 

You can download the .html for review or you can use the .rmd to see the code.

For the best result or format, simply download the .html and go thru all the lines.

Recommendation: 

For beginner, understand the code and work it on your RStudio. 

For refresher, i would just simply search thru the function and see what do you need. 

If you would like to go deeper, you can just simply find a book specifically for R to learn the concepts, but in general, i dont think you will need to go that deep. Since R is specifically for statistics purposes nor for software engineering. Therefore, this guide should cover 80-90% of what you need for R portion.

This material will not cover the ggplot or something, but it does cover the base R.
